                    Originally from Maryland, I relocated to Queens, NY to pursue an undergraduate degree in economics at St. John's University. After graduating I began my career in finance. 
                    For the last 7 years I have worked in asset management. In 2021, I decided it was time for a change and began my journey as a full stack developer and enrolled in a coding bootcamp
                    at Rutger's University. I have gained new skills in CSS, HTML, Javascript, and the MERN stack. I enjoy both the creative and technical components in the world of coding.
